<h1>
    I’ve always enjoyed mobile computing or the ability to do computing tasks with my mobile devices anywhere.
    <h1>
    Mobile computing has given me the flexibility to multi-task and maximize my time. Unfortunately, it hasn’t always
    <h1> 
    been a great experience.
    <h1>
    Here are some of my good and bad observations in mobile computing.
    <h1>
    The Good
    <h1>
   Being productive during down time. Obviously, being able to work virtually anywhere is the best benefit of the mobile
   <h1>
   computing. There are times when you want to do some work when you have some down time, like when you’re waiting for
   <h1>
   your flight, waiting for someone in a restaurant, and other waiting activities.
   <h1>
   Being able to work when you least expect it. There are times when you suddenly need to do some report, respond to an important email,
    <h1>
    or send a file asap. During these times, it’s reassuring to know that you can just power on your mobile device 
    <h1>
    and start working! Globalization has made working with co-workers from other countries and different timezones a necessity.
   <h1>
   As a result, your working hours is oftentimes disregarded by your foreign counterparts.
   <h1>
   Being able to play my multimedia collection anywhere. All work and no play can may you a dull person.
   <h1> 
   the bad
   <h1>
   
    Rest time is no longer rest time. Although we can do some tasks on our computers during our rest time or down 
     <h1>
     time, it also takes away actual time for rest. Our minds and bodies need time to calm down and recharge, too.
    <h1>
    Work-Life Imbalance can happen. This is another sad consequence of mobile computing. Because we can do our work 
    <h1>
    anywhere, we tend to work at home. When we do work from home, or when we bring home our work, we eat up time we 
    <h1>
    can spend for our family, or for personal time. This imbalance often results in workaholism.
    <h1>
    We become connected 24/7. As cool as it may sound, being connected 24/7 is not healthy. Being connected all the
   <h1>
    time
   <h1>
    can keep you up all night resulting in lack of sleep. Lack of sleep has been proven to cause a lot of sickness.
   <h1>
    Another ill effect of being connected 24/7 is the one mentioned in the previous bullet point: work-life imbalance.
    <h1>
    There are more good and bad observations about you may think of about mobile computing. The negative aspect of it can 
    <h1>
    be fixed by setting your priorities straight and developing self-discipline. And, like most things in life,
   <h1>
    moderation is key.
