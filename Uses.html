    (1)the uses of computer in eduction :.
    <h1>
    Computers are one of the most valuable resources in a classroom because they serve so many useful functions.
    <h1> 
   With computers and the internet, students today have a wealth of information at their fingertips that can help
   <h1>
   them develop their research and communication skills while preparing them for a future career in a workforce that 
   <h1>
   is increasingly reliant on computer technology.
   <h1>
   One of the most common applications of computers in education today involves the ongoing use of educational 
   <h1>
   software and programs that facilitate personalized online instruction for students. Programs like iReady use
   <h1>
   computers to assess students in reading and math. Students then work on interactive reading and math lessons that 
   <h1> 
   hare designed to target the specific academic needs identified during diagnostic testing. Educational software
   <h1>
   like this makes it easier to differentiate instruction so that lessons meet each student’s unique learning needs.
   <h1>
   These tools also provide a wealth of useful data and resources that teachers can use to work with their students
   <h1>
   in the classroom and maximize learning. Online assessments are more efficient than traditional paper testing 
   <h1>
   because it allows for more immediate feedback and data.
   <h1>
   Computers also have an important role beyond primary and secondary education classrooms. Thanks to computers 
   <h1>
   and technological advancements, higher education is now more accessible than ever. Many colleges and universities
   <h1> 
   offer online classes, and some even offer degree programs that can be completed exclusively online. Online  
  <h1>
   classes and  online degree programs make it easier for single parents or students with heavy workloads to
  <h1>
   continue their  education from the comfort of their own home and at their own pace.
   <h1>
   (2)Computers Are Used for Communication
   <h1>
   When it comes to establishing contact with clients, computers are a vital tool; they are also vital when it
   <h1>
   comes to maintaining that contact. This is a very important computer application in business, enabling a 
   <h1>
   business to communicate with its clients via email, IM, Skype, collaboration software, and via various other
   <h1>
   communication solutions that a business might wish to use.
   <h1>
  When a business can keep in touch with its clients, it becomes easier for the clients to make inquiries of 
  <h1>
  the business or to ask for more information about the services and products the business offers. It also becomes
   <h1>
   easier for the business to offer customer support to its clients in a timely, efficient manner. The business 
   <h1>
   will also be able to keep the clients updated about any new developments concerning the business.
   <h1>
  Communication goes beyond a business' clients. A business also needs to communicate with its employees, and 
   <h1>
   computers play an important role. Rather than have time-wasting one-on-one meetings with employees, managers
   <h1>
   can simply email their employees or they can message them on any other acceptable communication platform. 
   <h1>
   This saves time, and it also improves the internal communication of the business.
   <h1>
  (3)Computers Are Used for Marketing
   <h1>
   Computers allow a business to perform a variety of tasks. For starters, with the help of the internet,
   <h1>
   computers help put a business on the map. With a computer, a business’s team of IT developers can create 
   <h1>
   a professional website complete with enticing graphics and content with different forms of media, such as
   <h1>
   text, images, and videos. They can do search engine optimization – SEO – for the website so that it appears 
  <h1>
   prominently in Google’s search results, which then attracts traffic, which, ultimately, will enable the 
   <h1>
   business to sell those products to website visitors.
   <h1>
   With a computer, a business can create and execute entire marketing campaigns that span across every social
   <h1>
   media platform on the internet. The business can create ads to run on websites and social media platforms, 
   <h1>
   using special software, and it can also buy marketing services from other businesses – all connected to the  
   <h1>
   internet. The computer is likely the greatest marketing device ever built!
   <h1>
  (4)Computers Are Used for Accounting
   <h1>
   Accounting is a function in which accuracy is of the utmost importance. When you perform accounting functions –
   <h1>
   and you have nothing nothing except pen and paper - and you're relying solely on brain power, you expose yourself
   <h1>
   to errors. Accounting software helps prevent that from happening.
   <h1>
   Accounting software enables a business to quickly and accurately obtain large- and small-scale pictures of 
   <h1>
   the company's financial situation. All the employees need to do is to input his financial information into the
  <h1>
   software and – with a few clicks – the employees understand everything about the financial health of the business'
  <h1>
   operations.
   <h1>
   Computers are also critical for tasks such as invoicing clients; maintaining data about debtors and creditors;
   <h1>
   calculating payroll, calculating and filing tax forms, as well as for a lot of other functions.
   <h1>
   With the computer, accountants can now focus on the higher level picture of a business’s finances, leaving
   <h1>
   the lower level stuff to the machines.
   <h1>
  (5)Computers Are Used for Storage
   <h1>
   Businesses have come a long way from the era of filing cabinets thanks to computers. Although a filing cabinet will
   <h1>
   occupy a very large space but will store only a small amount of information, a computer will occupy only a fraction 
   <h1>
   of that space but it will store thousands of times the amount of information. With computers and servers,
   <h1>
   businesses are able to store and sort millions of files, to enable the business to access at any time.
   <h1>
   omputers also enable a business to store its data in different ways. The business could store the data in a central location, and it could have other computers on the network access the data whenever the business needs to; when the business has the permission to; or, when the business could store the data locally on individual computers.
   <h1>
   Not only is digital storage much larger than physical storage in terms of capacity, but it is also much more
   <h1>
   efficient because of the level of sorting that takes place, which is one of the greatest benefits of the computer.
  <h1>
   Digital storage is also more secure, as it is more difficult to lose or steal files from a well-protected database.
   <h1>
  (6)Computers Are Used to Produce Documents
   <h1>
   Most businesses will need to produce numerous documents, either in the form of written documents or spreadsheets.
   <h1>
   Computers provide word processors and spreadsheet software to help with this.
   <h1>
   With these two types of software, a business can generate virtually everything, from memos to letters to
   tutorials to reports 
   <h1>
   to ads for the company’s services and products or company events.
   <h1>
   With spreadsheet applications, a business has the power to manipulate alphanumeric data and organize it into tables,
   <h1>
   charts, graphs, and reports. Another kind of software that businesses make use of is presentation software.
   <h1> 
   With presentation software, a business can make slides for presentations, either internal 
   <h1>
   ones or external ones meantfor clients. Businesses can also make letters, memos, and reports, using word
   <h1>
   processing software, either for disbursement to the client or for internal use.
   <h1>
   In general, a computer has plenty of productivity software that a business can use to make its functions easier; 
   <h1>
   this is software that enables a business to be much faster and more efficient that it was only 20 or 30 years ago.
   <h1>
  (7)Computers Are Used for Educational Purposes
   <h1>
   Computers can be used to educate employees. A business can use a computer to educate the employees on such
   <h1>
   things as the company policy, software use, as well as standard procedures and safety.
   <h1>
   Rather than hire teachers to teach its employees, a business can let employees learn what the employee needs, 
   <h1>
   by learning at their own pace via webinars and live Q&A sessions. With the internet, a business' employees
   <h1>
   will have access to a world of information, and the business will not need to create all of its own educational 
  <h1>
   content.
  
   Computers also enable employees to learn in a way that they enjoy. Employees can learn via different media, 
   <h1>
   such as videos, text, and even games, enabling them to better understand the subject matter.
  
   (8)Computers Are Used for Research
   <h1>
   Computers allow a business to do a variety of things, including research about the competition, as well as what 
   <h1>
   its customers want. With modern data-mining techniques, a business can acquire insightful information about its  
   <h1>
   customers and competition from all kinds of places, including forums, search engines, industry-specific websites 
   <h1>
   and even from social networks.
