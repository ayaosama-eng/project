            It gives drivers greater mobility and independence, and some people may even symbolize social status. These reasons, and the associated increase in the availability of affordable cars, have led to a rapid growth in car ownership - in 2010, the number of cars in the world reached 1,015 billion cars, but by 2035 the number of cars on the roads is expected to reach 1 7 billion cars. This growth will negatively affect the time spent on the trip, as employees in the United States of America spend an average of 38 hours a year stuck in the traffic jam between work and home.

        <td>Driverless cars represent a shift in the way we understand transportation, both     technologically and socially. However, achieving an independent future depends       on a number of key elements such as culture, political will, raising public         awareness, and user acceptance. Over a period of six months, the architecture of     the hardware and software used in driverless Buggy golf carts has been               reproduced in a SCOT, an electric vehicle converted into a driverless car for       use on public roads. This car provides the ability to move on demand (MoD),         which is a simple concept through which smart electric cars can move                 independently from human interference, and stop to take and drop passengers.         This is a flexible transportation system that balances demand and real-time         planning.

            Google Assistant is a virtual personal assistant that has been developed in Google format now as well as the OK Google voice command service, except that the distinction in Google Assistant is that it works through a personal chat system, so that you can direct the questions and commands you want inside the chat box by writing them or through the microphone and Google Assistant will answer you and answer your questions also in the same manner as chat programs with the slight difference that you are chatting with an AI machine and not with a real friend.

        The long-term economic effects
        of AI are uncertain. A survey 
        of economists showed disagreement
        about whether the increasing use
        of robots and AI will cause a
        substantial increase in long-term 
        unemployment, but they generally 
        agree that it could be a net benefit,
        if productivity gains are redistributed
        .[402] A February 2020 European Union
        white paper on artificial intelligence
        advocated for artificial intelligence
        for economic benefits, including 
        "improving healthcare (e.g. making 
        diagnosis more precise, enabling 
        better prevention of diseases), 
        increasing the efficiency of farming
        , contributing to climate change 
        mitigation and adaptation, [and] 
        improving the efficiency of production
        systems through predictive maintenance
        ", while acknowledging potential risks
