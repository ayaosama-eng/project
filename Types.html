		<h1>
			Mobile computer devices are designed to be portable, often to fit on your lap 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			in the palm of your hand or in your pocket. With some mobile devices, you can 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			do many of the things you do with a desktop computer while you are away from 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			home or traveling. Features in mobile computer devices include batteries, video 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			camera, camera, voice recorder and music player. Laptop computers, tablets, 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			smartphones, e-readers and handheld gaming devices are five types of mobile 
    </h1>
		<h1>
			ocations. Many laptops on the market are designed to offer you all the functionality>
		</h1>
		<h1>
			of a desktop computer, which means you can run the same software and open the same types of files.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			The laptop has an all-in-one design with built-in touchpad, keyboard, monitor and speakers.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Laptops also offer you the option of connecting to a larger monitor, regular mouse and other
		</h1>
		<h1>
			peripherals. This feature means you can turn a laptop into a desktop computer, but one you can
		</h1>
		<h1>
			disconnect from the peripherals and carry with you wherever you go. 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Most laptops have the same types of ports desktop computers have -- USB, HDMI and Firewire -- although
		</h1>
		<h1>
			there are usually fewer of them to save space. However, some laptop ports are different from desktop
		</h1>
		<h1>
			computers and may require an adapter to use them. For example, the monitor port on a laptop is
		</h1>
		<h1>
			a Mini DisplayPort, which is smaller than the DisplayPort on a desktop computer.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			(2)Tablets
		</h1>
		<img src ="tab.jpg "  height = "250"  width = "300" />
			Tablets are also designed to offer portability. However, they provide you with a computing experience different
		<h1>
			from laptops with the biggest difference being that tablets do not have a touchpad or keyboard. Instead, the 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			touch screen offers a virtual keyboard you use to input text, while your finger replaces the mouse as a pointer.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Tablets are bigger than a smartphone and smaller than a laptop. Like the smartphone, you can browse the Internet, carry out videoconferences, stay connected through email, read e-books, play games, watch movies, share photos and listen to music with the tablet.
		</h1>    
		<h1>    
			Basic features of tablet computers include:
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Mobile OS: Tablets run on mobile operating systems different from their desktop counterparts. Examples include 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Windows, iOS and Android.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Solid-state drives: Tablets use solid-state drives, which are faster and more durable than hard disk drives.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Wi-Fi: Because tablets are optimized for Internet use, they have built-in Wi-Fi.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			(3) Smartphones
		</h1>
		<img src="mob.png"  height="250"  width="300" />
		<h1>
			A smartphone is a powerful mobile phone capable of running applications in addition to providing with phone 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			service. These devices have most of the features available on tablets along with cellular Internet connectivity.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Cell phone companies offer data plans that offer you Internet access anywhere with coverage.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			(4)E-Readers
		</h1>
		<h1>
			E-readers, or e-book readers, resemble tablet computers, but that they are mainly designed for reading digital
		</h1>
		<h1>
			and downloadable documents. E-readers have either an LCD or e-ink display.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			LCD Display: This is the same screen found on laptops and tablet computers. This type of screen is suitable for
		</h1>
		<h1>
			viewing books and magazines with photos because the LCD screen can display colors.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			E-Ink Display: E-ink is short for electronic ink and usually displays in black and white. It is designed to
		</h1>
		<h1>
			offer you the look of an actual page in a book. Unlike the LCD display, the e-ink version is not backlit, so
		</h1>
		<h1>
			text is readable even outdoors in full sun. E-ink displays offer a reading experience with less eyestrain.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			(5)Handheld Gaming Devices
		</h1>
		<img src="hand.jpg"  height="250"  width="300" />
			Handheld gaming devices are portable, lightweight video game consoles that have built-in game controls, screen 
		<h1>
			and speakers. With a handheld gaming console, you can play your favorite console games wherever you are,
		</h1>
			whether on the move or while someone else is watching the TV.
		<h1>
			(6) electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations,
		</h1>
		<img src="cal.jpg"    height="250"  width="300" />
		<h1>
			ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became
		</h1>
		<h1>
			available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel
		</h1>
		<h1>
			for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry
		</h1>
		<h1>
			(oil and gas).
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			built-in printers.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and
		</h1>
		<h1>
			they became common in schools.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and
		</h1>
		<h1>
			hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices,
		</h1>
		<h1>
			the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example,
		</h1>
		<h1>
			there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators
		</h1>
		<h1>
			even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the
		</h1>
		<h1>
			real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and
		</h1>
		<h1>
			graphing models tend to cost more.
		</h1>
		<h1>
			In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute 
		</h1>
		<h1>
			information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%
