<h1>
    mobile computing is human–computer interaction in which a computer is expected
    <h1>
    to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, 
    <h1>
    voice and video.
    <h1>
    Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software.
    <h1>
    Communication issues include ad hoc networks and infrastructure networks as well as
    <h1>
    communication properties, protocols, data formats and concrete technologies. 
    <h1>
    Hardware includes mobile devices or device components.
    <h1>
    Mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications
    <h1>
    Mobile computing devices are generally modern-day handheld devices that have the hardware
    <h1>
    and software required to execute typical desktop and Web applications. Mobile computing
    <h1>
    devices have similar hardware and software components as those used in personal computers,
    <h1>
    such as processors, random memory and storage, Wi-Fi, and a base operating system. However,
    <h1>
    they differ from PCS in that they are built specifically for mobile architecture and to 
    <h1>
    enable portability.
    <h1>
    Among the common examples of mobile computing devices is a tablet PC, which has a built-in processor,
    <h1>
    memory anMobid operating system (OS), and executes most applications built for a comparable PC.
    <h1>
    Device mobility can be viewed in the context of several qualities:[1]
  
  physical dimation  and weight
  <h1>
  Whether the device is mobile or some kind of host to which it is attached is mobile
  <h1>
   towhat kind of host devices can it be bound
  <h1>
  How devices communicate with a host
  <h1>
  When the mobility occurs
  <h1>
  Strictly speaking, many so-called mobile devices are not mobile. It is the host that is mobile, i.e., a mobile
  <h1>
   human host carries a non-mobile smartphone device. An example of a true mobile computing device, where the
   <h1>
   device itself is mobile, is a robot. Another example is an autonomous vehicle. There are three basic ways mobile
   <h1>
   devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts: accompanied, surface-mounted or embedded into the fabric of a
   <h1>
   host, e.g., an embedded controller embedded in a host device. Accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound
   <h1>
   and accompanying a mobile host, e.g., a smartphone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced.
   <h1>
   [1] Hence, mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocket-sized.
   <h1>
  As stated earlier, the most common size of mobile computing device is pocket-sized that can be hand-held, but other
  <h1>
   sizes for mobile devices exist, too. Mark Weiser, known[by whom?] as the father of ubiquitous computing, computing
   <h1>
   everywhere, referred to device sizes that are tab-sized, pad and board sized,[2] where tabs are defined as accompan
   <h1>
   ied or wearable centimetre-sized devices, e.g. smartphones, and pads are defined as hand-held decimetre-sized 
   <h1>
   devices, e.g., laptops. If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non-planar, one can also
   <h1>
   have skin devices and tiny dust-sized devices.[1] Dust refers to miniaturised devices without direct HCI interfaces
   <h1>
   , e.g., micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres.
   <h1>
   See also Smart dust. Skin: fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices.
   <h1>
   These can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains,
   <h1>
   see OLED display. Also see smart device.
  <h1>
  Alth mobility is often regarded[by whom?] as synonymous with having wireless connectivity, these terms are
  <h1>
   different. Not all network access by mobile users, applications and devices need be via wireless networks and 
   <h1>
   vice versa. Wireless access devices can be static and mobile users can move in between wired and wireless 
   <h1>
   hotspots such as in Internet cafés.[1] Some mobile devices can be used as mobile Internet devices to access
   <h1>
   the Internet while moving but they do not need to do this and many phone functions or applications are still
   <h1>
   operational even while disconnected to the Internet. What makes the mobile device unique compared to other 
   <h1>
   technologies is the inherent flexibility in the hardware and also the software. Flexible applications include 
   <h1>
   video chat, Web browsing, payment systems, NFC, audio recording etc.[3] As mobile devices become ubiquitous
   <h1>
   there, will be a proliferation of services which include the use of the cloud.[citation needed] Although a 
   <h1>
   common form of mobile device, a smartphone, has a display, another perhaps even more common form of smart 
   <h1>
   computing device, the smart card, e.g., used as a bank card or travel card, does not have a display. This
   <h1>
   mobile device often has a CPU and memory but needs to connect, or be inserted into a reader in order to 
   <h1>
   display its internal data or state
